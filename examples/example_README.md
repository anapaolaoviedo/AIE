# Model README

This is a machine learning model developed to predict credit risk based on user financial data.

## Model Details
- Trained using XGBoost on a proprietary dataset.
- Features include income, age, loan history, and credit score.

## Ethical Considerations

We considered **fairness** during data collection, ensuring balanced representation of age and gender groups.

Although we have not yet added formal **explainability**, we plan to integrate SHAP values in a future version.

At this point, **bias mitigation** was handled through pre-processing techniques, including feature normalization.

**Transparency** of the model architecture and training procedure is documented in our internal model card.

## Known Limitations

- Currently no user **consent** form for data usage (in development).
- Lacks automated auditing or **accountability** mechanisms.
