# üïäÔ∏è AIE ‚Äî AI Ethical Analyzer

AIE (AI Ethical Analyzer) is a **static analysis tool** that flags potential ethical concerns in machine learning models and their documentation.  
It empowers developers, data scientists, and organizations to build **fair, transparent, and responsible AI systems**.

## üåü Features

- **Bias Detection**: Parses model code to identify possible bias sources such as skewed training data or opaque decision pathways.
- **Documentation NLP Analysis**: Uses natural language processing to check for missing fairness statements, consent protocols, or transparency gaps in README files, model cards, and configs.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates a structured ethics risk report summarizing flagged issues and recommended improvements.
- **Flexible & Extensible**: Supports different frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) and integrates into existing workflows.

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Python** (core logic)
- **Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow** (model parsing support)
- **spaCy / transformers + regex** (for NLP on documentation)
- **YAML / JSON / Markdown parsers** (for README and config analysis)
- **CLI tool** (default) or optional **Flask + Streamlit UI** for visual reports
